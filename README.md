# Java DSA & OOP Journey ðŸš€
**Welcome to My Learning Adventure!** ðŸŒŸ

Hey everyone! This repository is where Iâ€™m documenting my journey to master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and deepen my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. Iâ€™m following Kunal Kushwahaâ€™s DSA videos and exploring core Java concepts to grow as a developer, one step at a time.

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here:
- **ðŸ“š Conceptual Notes & Insights**: Thoughtful summaries, diagrams, and notes for each topic I cover.
- **ðŸ’» Hands-On Code & Practice**: Practical implementations, examples, and challenges to reinforce my learning.
- **ðŸ”„ OOP Mastery**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction â€” all the essentials of OOP, documented and explained.
- **ðŸš€ Real-World Relevance**: Exploring how DSA and OOP concepts fit into real-world applications, focusing on practical problem-solving.

## Topics Covered:
New topics will be added as I progress, covering DSA, OOP, and more!
1. **Arrays & Strings**: Foundational manipulations, optimizations, and algorithms.
2. **Linked Lists**: Singly, doubly, and circular lists with advanced operations.
3. **Stacks & Queues**: Including complex variations and use cases.
4. **Trees & Graphs**: From binary trees to traversals and graph algorithms.
5. **Sorting & Searching**: Essential sorting methods and searching techniques.
6. **Dynamic Programming**: Building efficient solutions to complex problems.
7. **OOP Fundamentals**: Deep dives into inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.
